Synonyms and word variations.

Here we will cover how to give synonyms and word variations.

SYNONYMS

We will take the german words `glauben` and `meinen` as an example. Both of them translate as `think` to english, and if you add them to your vocabulary sheet separately, you will not know when to type which word. So, to give synonyms, we use `|` sign:
`glauben|meinen`. In this case you will have to give both words during the dictation. You will see this message: AAA


You can have as many synonyms as you like, the app will tell you how many there is and how many you still have to give.
If you want to provide additional information for synonyms, also use `|` sign, in the same order as you have given the words. For instance, if you wanted to give transcriptions, you would do it so: AAA


WORD VARIATIONS

Sometimes, nouns can have several plural forms, verbs - regular and irregular conjugations, adjectives - comparative and superlative forms. For instance, the plural form of the german word `Milch` (milk) can be both `Milche` and `Milchen`. In this case, you do not need to know both forms, one will be enough. You can add both forms to the sheet with `/` sign between them.
`Milche/Milchen`. You will be able to give any of those variations.
If you want to give additional information for variations, also use `/` sign.


You can combine synonyms and variations. For instance the word `zoo` can be translated to german both as `Zoo`(`Zoos` in the plural form) and `Tierpark`(has two plural forms: `Tierparks` and `Tierparke`). In this case you would combine synonyms and variations like this:
For singular form column: `Zoo|Tierpark`;
For plural form column: `Zoos|Tierparks/Tierparke`
